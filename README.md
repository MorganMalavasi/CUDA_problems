# CUDA_problems

In this work three problems that make up an algorithm are analyzed. The goal is to find the fastest version for each problem in order to make the algorithm as optimized as possible

## Installation

Use the package manager [pip] to install all the dependencies.

```bash
pip install ...
```

## Usage
